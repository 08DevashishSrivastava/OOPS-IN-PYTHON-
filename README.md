🧑‍💻 Python OOP (Object Oriented Programming) – Lecture Notes

This repository contains Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP) examples written as part of lecture-wise learning and practice.
The programs demonstrate core OOP concepts using simple and beginner-friendly code.

📌 Overview

The aim of this project is to understand:

What classes and objects are

Difference between class attributes and instance attributes

Use of self keyword

Working of constructors (__init__)

How methods work inside a class

These examples are suitable for beginners and college students.

🛠️ Language Used
